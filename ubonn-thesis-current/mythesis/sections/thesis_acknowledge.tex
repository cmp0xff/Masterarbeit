I would like to acknowledge the Bonn-Cologne Graduate School for Physics and 
Astronomy, the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn, the Universität 
zu Köln and my parents, who supported my Master study financially.

I am also grateful to Prof.\ Dr.\ Claus Kiefer, Prof.\ Dr.\ Hans-Peter Nilles 
and Prof.\ Dr.\ Friedrich W. Hehl, who gave me instructions into Gravity and 
guided my thesis carefully.

I would also like to thank my fellow group members: Branislav Nikolić, Nick 
Kwidzinski, Anton Krieger, David Wichmann, Dennis Piontek, Anirudh Gundhi and 
Matthias Dahlmanns, who helped me developing the ideas as well as commenting 
the thesis.
